Gist oEmbed and shortcode support with caching.

== Description ==

Enable oEmbed-like support for embedding Gists in your post content.

Allows for removing the external stylesheet dependency, so the styles can be added directly to your local stylesheet. Go ahead, style your Gists. Give them line numbers and alternating line background colors (check the included example stylesheet).

== Installation ==

Installing Blazer Six Gist oEmbed is just like installing most other plugins. [Check out the codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins) if you have any questions.
